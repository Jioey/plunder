## Programmatic Imitation Learning from Unlabeled and Noisy Demonstrations


Imitation Learning (IL) is a promising paradigm for teaching robots to perform novel tasks using demonstrations. Most existing approaches for IL utilize neural networks (NN), however, these methods suffer from several well-known limitations: they 1) require large amounts of training data, 2) are hard to interpret, and 3) are hard to refine and adapt.

There is an emerging interest in $\emph{Programmatic Imitation Learning}$ (PIL), which offers significant promise in addressing the above limitations.
